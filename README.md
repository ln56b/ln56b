### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 :herb:  I'm HÃ©lÃ¨ne, a web developer passionate about the open-source mindset, coding community and continuous learning process.

 I started coding in 2019 through a very practical and intensive course. Since then, I have aquired a deeper understanding of programming languages by learning low-level languages such as **C** and **Rust**.
 Along to my professional web development experience with **TypeScript** and **Angular**, I am very curious about trends in all web development frameworks, especially **React** eco-system.
 
 I enjoy :
 - conceiving scalable architectures
 - implementing clean code with a performance and UX focus
 - sharing views and best practices with pairs
